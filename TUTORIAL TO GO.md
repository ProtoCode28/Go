## WHERE DOES GO COME FROM?

* Developed by google in 2007​

* Google needed a programming language:​
    * As fast as C​

    * As easy as Python​

    * Inheritance like in Java​

* Google servers were a mix of those three languages​

* Go is an offspring from C​

## WHY GO?​

* has a fast compiler ​

* huge standard library ​

* has many built-in tools (for testing, code coverage, etc.) ​

* supports many platforms: ​

    * Linux 2.6.23 or later ​

    * macOS 10.8 or later​

    * Windows XP SP2 or later ​

    * FreeBSD 9.3 or later ​
    
* Works on arm and x86 ​

* No interpreter is required for execution​

* Used by huge IT companies like:​

    * Google​

    * Twitter​

    * Uber​

    * And many more​
    
## HOW TO WRITE GO CODE​

* Official guidelines are:​

    * Keep all the code in a single workspace​

    * A workspace contains many version control repositories​

    * Each repository contains one or more packages​

    * A package has at least one Go source file per directory​

    * A package directory path determines its import path​

* Different from other programming languages since their projects usually have separate work spaces and those are closely tied to version control repositories​
